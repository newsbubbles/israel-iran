## Long-term Significance

The October 7 attack represented the deadliest day for Israelis since the country's founding and sparked what would become the Gaza War. While the immediate conflict was between Israel and Hamas, the event had profound implications for the broader Israel-Iran conflict:

1. **Proxy Warfare**: The attack reinforced Israeli claims of Iran's proxy warfare strategy, with Hamas acting as an Iranian-supported group

2. **Strategic Calculations**: Israel's response to Hamas would eventually broaden to target other Iranian-backed groups including Hezbollah

3. **Regional Destabilization**: The attack and subsequent war destabilized the region, derailing normalization efforts between Israel and Saudi Arabia

4. **Escalation Pathway**: The October 7 attack began a chain of escalations that would eventually lead to direct Israel-Iran confrontation

5. **US Involvement**: The attack drew increased US military assets to the region to support Israel
