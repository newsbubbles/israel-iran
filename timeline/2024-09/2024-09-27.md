The assassination of Hassan Nasrallah represented one of the most significant blows to Iran's regional strategy:

1. **Leadership Void**: Eliminated the most experienced, charismatic and strategically sophisticated proxy leader in Iran's network

2. **Command Decapitation**: Removed not just Nasrallah but much of Hezbollah's senior command structure

3. **Strategic Messaging**: Demonstrated Israel's intelligence reach and willingness to conduct high-risk operations

4. **Escalation Pathway**: Created direct pressure on Iran to respond rather than rely only on proxy retaliation

5. **Regional Psychology**: Shattered the carefully cultivated image of Hezbollah's secretary-general as untouchable
