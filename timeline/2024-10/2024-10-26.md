- Signaled precise intelligence about Iranian military capabilities
- Maintained unofficial "nuclear red line" by avoiding nuclear facilities

## Media Coverage Analysis

### Israeli Media
- Focus on successful penetration of Iranian airspace
- Emphasis on "proportionate response" to Iranian missile attacks
- Technical discussion of target selection and precision
- Analysis of potential Iranian responses and preparedness measures

### Iranian Media
