# Israel-Iran War Research Project

## Project Purpose
This project aims to create a comprehensive research log tracking the Israel-Iran conflict from multiple perspectives. The goal is to systematically collect, analyze, and organize information to enable cross-referencing, pattern identification, and potentially predict future developments based on historical and current data.

## Research Methodology
1. **Multi-perspective Analysis**: Research collects viewpoints from three primary sources:
   - Israeli perspective (Hebrew sources) [search in hebrew]
   - Iranian perspective (Farsi sources) [search in farsi]
   - US perspective (English sources) [search in english]

2. **Daily Tracking**: Information is organized chronologically with daily summaries.

3. **Media Analysis**: For each day, analyze the rhetoric, framing, and key narratives in news coverage.

4. **Keyword Extraction**: Identify and track recurring terms, phrases, and concepts from all sources.

5. **Cross-referencing**: Compare how the same events are reported across different perspectives.

## File Naming Conventions
- Daily summaries: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Timeline entries: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Topic analyses: `[topic-name].md`
- Perspective files: `[topic-name]-[perspective].md`

## Content Guidelines

### Daily Summaries
Each daily summary should include:
- Major events of the day
- Sources consulted (with links)
- Cross-perspective analysis (how the same events were reported differently)
- Key quotes from officials
- Media framing analysis
- Extracted keywords

### Timeline Entries
Timeline files should contain:
- Chronological list of events with timestamps when available
- Source verification (multiple sources confirming the same event)
- Significance assessment

### Perspective Analysis
Perspective files should:
- Clearly distinguish facts from opinions
- Identify biases in reporting
- Track recurring narratives
- Note changes in tone or position over time

### Media Analysis
Media analysis should examine:
- Rhetorical devices used
- Framing techniques
- Visual elements (if applicable)
- Word choice and emphasis
- Narrative construction

### Keywords
Keyword tracking should:
- Identify frequency of terms
- Note context of usage
- Track emerging terminology
- Compare keyword usage across perspectives

### Predictions
Prediction documents should:
- Clearly state assumptions
- Reference historical patterns
- Provide multiple scenarios
- Assign confidence levels
- Revisit and update based on new information

## Research Process
1. Collect daily information from multiple sources in Hebrew, Farsi, and English
2. Organize raw information into respective folders
3. Create daily summaries that synthesize the collected information
4. Extract keywords and analyze media framing
5. Update timeline with verified events
6. Periodically review collected data to identify patterns and formulate predictions
7. Cross-reference information across perspectives and sources

## Note on Objectivity
This research project aims to present multiple perspectives without endorsing any particular viewpoint. The goal is to understand the full spectrum of positions and information available about the conflict to enable more informed analysis.
