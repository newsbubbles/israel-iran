## Conclusion

The rhetorical strategies employed by media outlets across the three perspectives reveal fundamental differences in how the conflict is conceptualized and presented to audiences. Israeli media frames the conflict as a necessary defensive action against an existential threat, employing clinical and technical language to emphasize precision and minimize perception of civilian impact. Iranian media employs moral and religious framing, emphasizing victimhood and resistance against aggression, while highlighting technological achievements as symbols of national pride. US media adopts a more analytical approach, contextualizing the conflict within broader geopolitical and diplomatic frameworks while maintaining greater emotional distance.

These different rhetorical approaches not only reflect existing perspectives but actively shape and reinforce them, creating distinct narrative universes for audiences across the three societies. The selective emphasis, terminology choices, and visual framing contribute to fundamentally different understandings of the same events, highlighting the critical role media rhetoric plays in conflict perception.
