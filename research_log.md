  - September 27, 2024 - Israeli airstrike kills Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah
  - October 1, 2024 - Iran's second direct missile attack on Israel
  - October 16, 2024 - Elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza
  - October 26, 2024 - Israel's first direct attack on Iranian territory
  - June 13, 2025 - Beginning of current conflict with Israeli strikes on Iran
  - June 14-15, 2025 - Continued exchange of strikes between Israel and Iran

### Daily Summaries

- Created comprehensive daily summaries for the current conflict:
  - June 13, 2025 - First day of major Israeli attack on Iran
  - June 14, 2025 - Expansion of Israeli strikes to include energy infrastructure
  - June 15, 2025 - Iranian deployment of advanced missile systems
  - June 16, 2025 - Fourth day with continuing exchanges

### Perspective Analysis

- Developed detailed perspective documents:
  - Israeli perspective on strategic threat from Iran
  - Iranian perspective on nuclear program and conflict
  - US perspective on policy considerations and options

### Media and Rhetorical Analysis

- Comparative analysis of media coverage across US, Israeli, and Iranian sources
- Detailed examination of rhetorical techniques and framing in different media environments
- Keyword frequency and usage analysis showing divergent terminological patterns

### Specialized Topic Reports

- Analysis of Iranian missile capabilities demonstrated in conflict
- Assessment of US role in the conflict (military, diplomatic, intelligence)
- Preliminary scenario analysis with probability assignments

## Research Challenges and Gaps

Several significant research challenges have emerged during our work:

- **Information verification**: Significant propaganda and information warfare complicates objective assessment
- **Technical details**: Precise damage assessments and military capabilities remain difficult to verify
- **Translation limitations**: Full analysis of Hebrew and Farsi sources limited by translation resources
- **Rapidly evolving situation**: New developments potentially supersede analysis in real time
- **Source diversity**: Ensuring balanced representation of perspectives despite information asymmetries

## Next Steps

### Priority Research Areas

1. **Daily monitoring**: Continue tracking and documenting daily developments
2. **Historical context**: Deeper exploration of pre-2023 events that shaped current conflict
3. **Regional perspectives**: Expand analysis to include Saudi, Turkish, and Egyptian viewpoints
4. **Economic impact**: Detailed assessment of conflict's effect on global energy markets
5. **Diplomatic initiatives**: Track and analyze ongoing mediation and ceasefire efforts

### Methodological Improvements

- Implement standardized verification protocols for conflicting claims
- Develop more systematic approach to translation and analysis of non-English sources
- Create visualization tools for timeline and relationship mapping
- Establish prediction tracking methodology to evaluate analytical accuracy
- Enhance cross-referencing between different document categories

### Document Expansion Plan

- Back-fill summaries for additional key dates in conflict timeline
- Create specific analysis of proxy group involvement and potential
- Develop economic impact assessment focusing on energy markets
- Produce regional response analysis examining positions of key Middle Eastern states
- Compile comprehensive glossary of technical terms and key figures

## Research Team Notes

- Maintaining analytical distance while documenting multiple perspectives remains challenging
- Information environment highly contaminated by propaganda from all sides
- Technical verification of military claims requires specialized expertise
- Historical patterns provide useful context but may not accurately predict current outcomes
- Scenario planning requires regular revision as new information emerges

Next comprehensive project update scheduled for June 20, 2025.
