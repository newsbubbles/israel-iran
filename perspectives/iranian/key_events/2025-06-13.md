## Conclusion

From the Iranian perspective, the June 13 Israeli strikes represent an illegal, unprovoked act of aggression against a sovereign nation that requires a significant response. Iranian officials and media frame the attack as targeting peaceful nuclear facilities, violating international law, and threatening civilian lives. The narrative emphasizes Iran's victimhood, the illegal nature of the attack, Western hypocrisy, and the inevitable powerful retaliation. While acknowledging some damage, Iranian sources minimize the operational impact on nuclear facilities while maximizing the moral and legal culpability of Israel and its supporters. The framing serves both domestic purposes of rallying public support and international objectives of building diplomatic pressure against Israel, while preparing the groundwork for Iran's military response.
