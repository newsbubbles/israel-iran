### Recent Progress (June 22, 2025)

**Completed Today**:

1. **June 19 Daily Summary and Perspectives**
   - Comprehensive analysis of key events including:
     - Iranian missile strike on Soroka Hospital in Beersheba
     - Intensification of Iranian missile campaign with advanced weapons systems

     - Widespread Iranian civilian infrastructure impacts from Israeli strikes
     - Reduced Iranian missile response capabilities
     - Increased regional proxy activity, particularly from Hezbollah
   - Three detailed perspective updates analyzing each major actor's position on June 20 developments

### Content Gap Analysis

Based on the project's stated goals and the current progress, the following gaps exist in the research:

1. **Time Gap**: Approximately 2 days (June 21-22) of recent developments need to be documented

2. **Perspective Gap**: Regional perspectives beyond the core three (Israeli, Iranian, US) remain to be developed

3. **Thematic Gap**: Economic impact and diplomatic initiatives require more detailed analysis

4. **Prediction Updates**: Initial predictions need to be reassessed based on newest developments

### Next Steps Priority

The following priorities have been identified for immediate action:

1. Complete daily summaries and perspective analyses for June 21-22, 2025
2. Develop Saudi perspective analysis as the first additional regional viewpoint
3. Conduct detailed analysis of energy market impacts from the conflict
4. Create comprehensive assessment of diplomatic initiatives following the failed Geneva talks
5. Update predictions based on US military authorization and its implications

### Conclusion

The Israel-Iran Conflict Research Project continues to make methodical progress in documenting and analyzing this rapidly evolving conflict. With the completion of June 20 analysis, we have documented a significant inflection point - President Trump's authorization of US military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities within a 72-hour window. This represents a dramatic escalation that transforms the conflict from a bilateral confrontation to one involving direct US military action.

The current analysis captures the multi-perspective framing of this development, with Israeli sources viewing it as a strategic victory, Iranian officials condemning it as illegal aggression, and US authorities presenting it as a limited, last-resort action focused specifically on nuclear facilities.

The research now needs to track developments in the final 2 days leading up to our current date, with particular focus on whether US strikes have commenced and how Iran has responded.
