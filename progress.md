### Conclusion

The Israel-Iran Conflict Research Project has successfully documented and analyzed the conflict from its outbreak on June 13 through its current critical juncture on June 22, 2025. The research captures what appears to be the eve of direct US military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, representing a historic escalation from what began as a bilateral conflict.

The documentation and analysis have evolved to capture increasingly complex dimensions of the conflict, including detailed military operations, diplomatic initiatives, economic impacts, and most recently, social dynamics particularly within Iranian society. This multidimensional approach provides a comprehensive understanding of not just what is happening but why it is happening and what may happen next.

The June 22 forecast represents our most current assessment, indicating that while Major Escalation with Direct US Involvement is now the most likely scenario (65%), alternative pathways remain possible, including a last-minute diplomatic breakthrough (20%), expansion into Major Regional War (15%), or the newly identified possibility of Iranian Internal Transformation (5%).

As US strikes appear imminent based on multiple indicators, the research has positioned us to understand and analyze the coming developments within their proper strategic, diplomatic, military, economic, and social context. The next 24-48 hours will likely represent a decisive turning point in the conflict with far-reaching implications for regional and global security.
