# Israel-Iran Conflict Research Project

## Project Overview

This research project systematically tracks and analyzes the Israel-Iran conflict, with a focus on multi-perspective analysis, daily summaries, media rhetoric analysis, and predictive assessment. The project organizes information chronologically and thematically to enable pattern recognition and cross-referencing.

## Key Project Sections

### [Daily Summaries](/summaries/)

Comprehensive daily briefings that synthesize major events, perspectives, media coverage, and key terminology.

Recent summaries:
- [June 16, 2025](/summaries/2025-06/2025-06-16.md) - Fourth day of open conflict with missile exchanges

### [Timeline](/timeline/)

Chronological tracking of events with timestamps, source verification, and significance assessment.

Key timeline documents:
- [Master Timeline](/timeline/master-timeline.md) - Complete chronological overview
- [June 16, 2025 Timeline](/timeline/2025-06/2025-06-16.md) - Detailed events of recent developments

### [Perspectives](/perspectives/)

Analysis of how the conflict is viewed and portrayed from different national viewpoints.

- [Israeli Perspective](/perspectives/israeli/) - Analysis of Israeli government statements, media framing, and public opinion
- [Iranian Perspective](/perspectives/iranian/) - Analysis of Iranian official positions, media coverage, and domestic reactions
- [US Perspective](/perspectives/us/) - Analysis of US policy positions, media coverage, and political discourse

### [Media Analysis](/media_analysis/)

Examination of rhetorical strategies, framing techniques, and narrative construction across different sources.

- [June 16 Rhetoric Analysis](/media_analysis/rhetoric/2025-06-16.md) - Comparative analysis of language and framing

### [Keywords](/keywords/)

Tracking of key terms, concepts, and rhetorical patterns in coverage of the conflict.

- [June 16 Keyword Analysis](/keywords/by_date/2025-06-16.md) - Frequency and context analysis of terminology

### [Predictions](/predictions/)

Analytical forecasting based on pattern recognition, multiple perspectives, and historical precedents.

- [Initial Assessment](/predictions/initial-assessment.md) - Probability-assigned scenarios and predictions

## Research Methodology

This project employs the following methodological approaches:

1. **Multi-perspective Analysis**: Deliberately examining events through Israeli, Iranian, and US viewpoints to identify biases and blind spots

2. **Cross-source Verification**: Comparing information across multiple primary and secondary sources

3. **Chronological/Thematic Organization**: Structuring information both temporally and conceptually to facilitate pattern recognition

4. **Media Literacy Approach**: Analyzing rhetorical strategies, framing techniques, and narrative construction

5. **Systematic Keyword Tracking**: Monitoring terminology patterns to identify shifting narratives and emphases

6. **Predictive Analysis**: Developing scenarios with probability assignments based on observed patterns and historical precedents

## Project Updates

This project is updated daily with new information and analysis. Major additions include:

- Daily summaries posted by end of day (UTC)
- Timeline updates as events occur
- Perspective analyses updated with new statements and media coverage
- Weekly analytical reports synthesizing patterns and trends
- Prediction revisions when significant new information emerges

## Research Team Notes

- The goal is to maintain analytical distance while acknowledging the inherent biases in sources
- We strive for factual accuracy while recognizing the challenges of real-time information in conflict situations
- All predictive assessments include clearly stated assumptions and probability levels
- Feedback and additional source suggestions are welcome through the project contact form
