## Conclusion

The United States occupies a central though complex position in the Israel-Iran conflict. Its substantial military, diplomatic, and economic involvement fundamentally shapes the conflict's parameters, while its relationship with both primary actors creates unique constraints and opportunities.

US policy under the Trump administration has attempted to balance unequivocal support for Israel's security with efforts to prevent regional escalation and protect American interests. While providing significant defensive military support and intelligence sharing, the administration has carefully avoided direct offensive involvement while engaging in back-channel diplomacy to establish potential off-ramps.

The conflict highlights enduring tensions in US Middle East policy: between supporting Israel and preventing regional war, between opposing Iranian nuclear development and acknowledging Israeli nuclear ambiguity, and between military and diplomatic approaches to regional challenges.

How the United States navigates these tensions will substantially determine not only the immediate trajectory of the Israel-Iran conflict but also the long-term strategic landscape of the Middle East and America's role within it.
